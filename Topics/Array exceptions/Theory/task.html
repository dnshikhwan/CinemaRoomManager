<p>No wonder that different types of exceptions may occur when your program processes an array. To avoid them, you should be aware of the situations where you are at risk of having one and stick to a set of commonly used practices. Now let's learn what exactly we are dealing with here.</p>
<h5 id="nullpointerexception" style="text-align: center;">NullPointerException</h5>
<p>As you probably know by now, an array is a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/1940" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a reference type is a type of variable that stores a reference to an object located elsewhere in memory, rather than storing the object's value directly. | When an object is created using the new operator, it returns a reference to the location of the object in memory, allowing access to its fields and methods. Reference types can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, and returned as values from methods. They are important for creating complex, object-oriented programs in Java. Unlike primitive types, which store their values directly, reference types store a reference to an object. When comparing reference types using the == operator, it compares the references (memory addresses) rather than the actual values. Additionally, assigning one value of a reference variable to another creates a copy of the reference, rather than the value itself. Reference types can also refer to a special value that represents the fact that it is not initialized yet or does not have a value. It is important to note that in Java, the heap is the region of memory where objects are stored and allocated dynamically during runtime.">reference type</a>, which means its <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/1940" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a variable is a named storage location that is used to store a value of a specific type. | It is declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of value that can be stored in it. Every variable has a unique name, also known as an identifier, which is used to access its value. Variables can be declared and initialized in a single statement, and their value can be accessed and modified using the name. It's important to note that variables can be changed, meaning you can assign a new value to a variable without having to declare it again.">variable</a> can be <code class="language-java">null</code> , and that may lead to NPE.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] numbers = null;
int size = numbers.length; // It throws an NPE</code></pre>
<p>We will not dwell on this since we suppose that you are already familiar with NPEs and how to avoid them by using additional checks in your code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int size = numbers == null ? 0 : numbers.length;</code></pre>
<h5 id="negativearraysizeexception" style="text-align: center;">NegativeArraySizeException</h5>
<p>If you try to create an array with a negative size, your code will compile successfully, but this line will throw a <code class="language-java">NegativeArraySizeException</code> while executing.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int negSize = -1;
int[] numbers = new int[negSize]; // an exception here</code></pre>
<p>It's not very likely that you'll face this exception as a developer, but it makes sense to keep it in mind. To avoid it, simply do not use variables that can have a negative size when setting the size of an array.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"> An array may have a size greater than or equal to zero. If this is the case, the code will compile successfully and will <strong>not</strong> throw a <code class="language-java">NegativeArraySizeException</code> at runtime.</div>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="arrayindexoutofboundsexception" style="text-align: center;">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</h5>
<p>This is a fairly common exception that occurs while working with arrays. It is caused by attempting to access a non-existent element of the array.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int[] array = { 1, 2, 3 }; // an array of ints

int n1 = array[2]; // n1 is 3
int n2 = array[3]; // Exception</code></pre>
<p>In this code, the last line produces an <code class="language-java">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code> since the last index of the array in question is 2.</p>
<p>The code will throw the same exception if we try to access an element with a negative index:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">array[0];  // OK
array[-1]; // Exception</code></pre>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-primary"> Since a string can be considered as a sequence of characters, a similar exception may occur when accessing a non-existing element of a string. It is called <code class="language-java">StringIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.</div>
<p> </p>
<p>To avoid the <code class="language-java">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>, we may check if the given index belongs to the interval <strong>[0, length â€“ 1].</strong></p>
<p>For example, let's take a look at a program, displaying an element of the array by the index, provided in the input. If the index is out of bounds, the program prints a message instead of throwing an exception.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">public class NoIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] hardCodedArray = { 3, 2, 4, 5, 1 };

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        int index = scanner.nextInt();

        if (index &lt; 0 || index &gt; hardCodedArray.length - 1) {
            System.out.println("The index is out of bounds.");
        } else {
            System.out.println(hardCodedArray[index]);
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Here are some possible inputs and the corresponding outputs of the program:</p>
<ul>
<li>the index is 0, the program outputs "3";</li>
<li>the index is 1, the program outputs "2";</li>
<li>the index is 4, the program outputs "1";</li>
<li>the index is -1, the program outputs "The index is out of bounds.";</li>
<li>the index is 5, the program also outputs "The index is out of bounds.".</li>
</ul>
<p>That is how we can avoid <code class="language-java">ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>s by using a conditional statement and the <code class="language-java">length</code> property of an array.</p>
<p> </p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>We have considered three types of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/1940" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an array exception is an error that occurs when there is a problem with the use of arrays in a program. | There are several types of array exceptions, including NegativeArraySizeException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, and NullPointerException. NegativeArraySizeException is thrown when a program tries to create an array with a negative size, while ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException occurs when a program tries to access an element that does not exist in the array. A NullPointerException is thrown when a program tries to use an array variable that has not been initialized.">array exceptions</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code class="language-java">NullPointerException</code>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="language-java">NegativeArraySizeException</code> which you may face when you are creating an array with a negative size;</p>
</li>
